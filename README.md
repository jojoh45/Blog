# Blog Web Application

## Overview

This project is a Blog web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The main goal of this application is to provide users with a platform to create and view blog posts. Unlike traditional blog platforms, this version of the application does not utilize a database, meaning posts will not persist between sessions.

## Features

- **Create Posts:** Users can create new blog posts, providing a title and content.
- **View Posts:** Users can view existing blog posts on the homepage.
- **Styling:** Emphasis is placed on styling to ensure an engaging and pleasant user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend of the application.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** A templating language that generates HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **HTML/CSS:** Used for structuring the web pages and styling the application.
